Completed realization of six commands: objput, objget, objlist, objsetacl, 
objgetacl and objtestacl.
For each command, permission checking includes the following steps.
1.	check input command's number of arguments whether right.
2.	check user namer, group name whether legal.
3.	check object name whether includes "+" to handle the situation that one 
	may references others users' objects.
4.	check object name whether legal.
5.	check user_group to see whether user exists and belongs to the group.
6.	check user_object to see whether user has this object.
7.	check the corresponding acl to make sure whether user has permission.
The object size is unlimited, but I put a limit in user and group information, 
that is each user belongs to no more than ten groups.
I stored the list of legal user and group names in user_group, and the list of 
legal user and object names in user_object. When a new object was created by 
some user, I created an initial ACL and added a record to user_object.
