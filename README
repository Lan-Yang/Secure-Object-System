First, it builds a secure repository, which stores objects, acl objects and encrypted keys.
The repo is /home/lanyang
All commands except the following six executables, cannot access objects in the repo. (Executables are generated in /home/security-ly2331)
The six executables are:
1. objput -u username -k passphrase objname

2. objget -u username -k passphrase objname

3. objlist -u username [-l]

4. objsetacl -u username -g groupname objname

5. objgetacl -u username -g groupname objname

6. objtestacl -u username -g groupname -a access objname

For each command, username and groupname are checked, and for objput and objget, passphrase is also checked.
